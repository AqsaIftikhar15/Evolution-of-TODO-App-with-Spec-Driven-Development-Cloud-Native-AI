# 🧩 Evolution of a Todo App  
### Spec-Driven • Cloud-Native • AI-Powered

This repository documents the **planned evolution of a Todo application** from a simple in-memory Python CLI to a full-scale, cloud-native, AI-powered system.

The project is structured in **phases**, each introducing new architectural, technological, and conceptual layers while building toward a production-ready system.

---

## 📌 Project Planning Overview

- **Phase 1** is implemented as a **standalone, isolated folder** to demonstrate core logic, spec-driven development, and clean Python design.
- **Phase 2 onward**, the application will be **extended iteratively within the same codebase**, transforming the initial CLI into a full-stack, AI-enabled, cloud-deployed system.

This approach reflects **real-world software evolution**, rather than rebuilding from scratch at each step.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Planned)

| Phase | Focus | Technologies |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| Phase I | In-Memory CLI Application | Python, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus |
| Phase II | Full-Stack Web Application | Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB |
| Phase III | AI-Powered Todo Chatbot | OpenAI ChatKit, Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK |
| Phase IV | Local Kubernetes Deployment | Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl-ai, kagent |
| Phase V | Advanced Cloud Deployment | Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean DOKS |

> 📌 **Note**:  
> Phase 1 has its **own README** inside its folder, detailing implementation, specs, and usage.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice **spec-driven development**  
- Demonstrate **incremental system evolution**  
- Apply **agentic AI concepts** in real applications  
- Gain hands-on experience with **cloud-native architectures**  
- Build a project suitable for **hackathons, internships, and portfolio review**

---

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ Phase I: Completed (In-Memory Python CLI)  
- 🛠️ Phase II: In-Progress  
- 🧠 Phase III: Planned  
- ☸️ Phase IV: Planned  
- ☁️ Phase V: Planned  

---

## 📖 How to Navigate

- Start with **Phase 1** to understand the foundational design  
- Follow future phases to see how the same system scales across:
  - Web  
  - AI  
  - Kubernetes  
  - Cloud infrastructure  

---

This repository is both a **learning journey** and a **system design exercise**, focused on building software the way it evolves in real engineering teams.
