# Evolution-of-TODO-App-with-Spec-Driven-Development-Cloud-Native-AI

# Project Roadmap & Phases

This project is structured as a **multi-phase development journey**, progressing from a simple in-memory console application to a fully deployed, AI-powered, cloud-native system.  
Each phase builds on the previous one, introducing new technologies, architecture patterns, and levels of complexity.

---

## Phase I — In-Memory Python Console App

**Goal:**  
Build a foundational todo application using a **spec-driven, agentic development workflow**.

**Description:**  
A command-line todo application where all tasks are stored in memory. This phase focuses on:
- Learning and applying **Spec-Kit Plus**
- Using **Claude Code** for implementation
- Demonstrating clean, traceable, specification-based development

**Tech Stack:**
- Python
- Claude Code
- Spec-Kit Plus

---

## Phase II — Full-Stack Web Application

**Goal:**  
Transform the console-based application into a modern full-stack web application.

**Description:**  
The todo system evolves into a web app with a frontend and backend. Tasks are persisted in a database, and users interact through a browser-based UI.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js (Frontend)
- FastAPI (Backend)
- SQLModel (ORM)
- Neon DB (PostgreSQL)

---

## Phase III — AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

**Goal:**  
Introduce conversational AI to interact with the todo system.

**Description:**  
Users can manage tasks through natural language using an AI chatbot. This phase emphasizes **agentic workflows**, tool usage, and AI-driven task orchestration.

**Tech Stack:**
- OpenAI ChatKit
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- Official MCP SDK

---

## Phase IV — Local Kubernetes Deployment

**Goal:**  
Containerize and orchestrate the application locally using Kubernetes.

**Description:**  
The system is prepared for production-like environments by introducing containers, orchestration, and local cluster management.

**Tech Stack:**
- Docker
- Minikube
- Helm
- kubectl-ai
- kagent

---

## Phase V — Advanced Cloud Deployment

**Goal:**  
Deploy the system to the cloud with scalable, event-driven architecture.

**Description:**  
This phase focuses on cloud-native patterns, scalability, and distributed systems, enabling the application to handle real-world workloads.

**Tech Stack:**
- Kafka (Event Streaming)
- Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime)
- DigitalOcean DOKS (Kubernetes Service)

---

## Summary

Each phase represents a deliberate step toward building:
- Strong foundations in **spec-driven development**
- Practical experience with **AI-assisted coding**
- Real-world skills in **full-stack, cloud-native, and distributed systems**

This phased approach ensures clarity, scalability, and continuous learning throughout the project lifecycle.
